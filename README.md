This is my first attempt at building a website from scratch (with supplementary help from lecture notes).  
This website, named MyStudyKPI, is designed to be a website allowing students of the UMS Faculty of Computing and Informatics to record their key performance indicators (KPIs).

When completed, this website will allow the faculty student to execute several operations:
1. Register themselves and login to view their personal information
2. Edit their personal information
3. Manage their Activities, Competitions and Certifications obtained during their time with the faculty
4. Manage their challenges and future plans

This website will also have some level of backend capability when completed, programmed in PHP.

This project started on 12 November 2023.
